Various perspectives of the concepts of health and illness will be introduced. Emphasis is on understanding the origins, factors and conditions that determine health throughout the lifespan, how these factors influence one another and the role/impact of health care. Additional topics include how health is measured, the leading causes of death, illness and disability, as well as how health status has changed throughout history.

Many physical changes and associated functional decline are affected by modifiable factors such as sedentary lifestyles, substance abuse, and diet. Education, environment, and personal supports also play key roles in preventing illness and accidents (e.g. falls, driving accidents, and medication errors). The course addresses the interests of those working with older adults, and anyone who has older grandparents, parents, or friends.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><i> </i></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><i>(Cross-listed with GERON 201)</i></td></tr><P></table></center><Br><P>

For example, students could work as a member of a research team (on or off campus), or complete a placement at a health care, community-based, or other type of organization. Students must identify a supervisor, design an apprenticeship experience, establish individualized learning goals, and develop a plan for evaluation. As this course will be graded, there must be at least one academic deliverable (e.g., a review of the literature, proposal, presentation, knowledge dissemination product, etc.). The apprenticeship is unpaid and students will normally spend 6-8 hours per week for at least 12 weeks during the term.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><i>Department Consent Required</i></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><i>Prereq: Level at least 4A School of Public Health and Health Systems students</i></td></tr><p></table></center><Br><P>

Students will be required to identify and design community learning placements, including the establishment of specific learning and outcome objectives, and a method of evaluation. Provisions must be approved by the community agency and the course coordinator. Placements are normally 8 to 10 hours per week for 8 weeks. In the final week of the term students will meet to reflect upon and share their experience with fellow students. Students will also complete a written report detailing whether and how they achieved their objectives, what they learned from the process relevant to the practice of health promotion, and how their experience utilized or exemplified course based material and assignments. Reports will be reviewed and graded as pass/fail by both the community partner and a faculty service leader.</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><i> </i></td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><i>Prereq: Year 4 Bachelor of Health Promotion students or Bachelor of Public Health students only</i></td></tr><p></table></center><Br><P>
